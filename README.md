# URL Shortener project


-- This is a personal learning project, will try my best to push it to production

-- Features NextJS, Supabase (using both for the first time) and to be hosted on swappyspace.com + swppy.io domain for short URL's.

-- It's in early stages. I'm working on this in my spare time, since a full time job is in the way. :)
